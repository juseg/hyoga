Hyoga
=====

Hyoga is a thin wrapper arround xarray_ to read and plot PISM_ output datasets.
In the future, I hope to find the time and funds to let it grow into a more
developed library around paleo-glacier models. Hyōga (氷河) is the
Japanese word for glacier (lit. ice river).

Hyoga is at a very early stage of development and things may break.
Feel free to get in touch (https://juseg.github.io).
